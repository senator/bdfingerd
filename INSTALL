TO INSTALL:

As usual, on a GNU-compliant system, run

  ./configure
  make
  make install

with the last step done as root, of course.

This will install the binary to /usr/local/sbin by default, and the
configuration file to /usr/local/etc.  To change these values,
use

  ./configure --prefix=/usr

or something along those lines.  The --sysconfdir option can also
be used.


TO CONFIGURE:

  Edit /usr/local/etc/bdfingerd.conf  (or wherever you installed it) to 
your liking.  The file is well commented and explains the purpose of
every variable.  Then just run bdfingerd and you're all set.  If you 
should happen to have put bdfingerd.conf somewhere other than  /etc, 
/usr/etc/, /usr/local/etc, or the directory that you're actually in
when you run the 'bdfingerd' command, you will have to specify its name 
with the full path after the -c option to bdfingerd, such as

   bdfingerd -c /opt/etc/bdfingerd.conf


NEW SECURITY SCHEMES:

  The most unique feature of bdfingerd is its use of a public directory
where users can put their plan, project, pgpkey, forward, and nofinger
files, such that they can be read by a daemon that runs as the user
'nobody', yet users need give away no world or group permissions at
all on their home directories.

  To implement this new feature, the administrator should create
/var/spool/finger with permissions  drwxrwxrwt  (mode 1777), which
mean that any user can write to this directory, but none can delete the
files of another.

  In this directory, each user can create a directory in his name, and
therein place his plan, project, and those files, so that they can be
read by the world while his home directory need not be.

  You could also set a group owner for the /var/spool/finger if you
wished to be more discriminating about who can write there, and then
change permissions such that it would look something like:

drwxrwxr-t    5 root     users        4096 Mar  8 18:37 /var/spool/finger/

which would be fine.

Of course, if this task should not be carried out by the administrator,
the old $HOME/.plan kind of system, assuming the user in question gives
the neccessary permission on his home directory, will still work.


INETD:

  The Big Dumb Finger Daemon was designed for use as a standalone server,
however it does have an inetd mode.  Put a line like this in your
/etc/inetd.conf :

finger	stream	tcp	nowait	nobody	/usr/sbin/tcpd	/usr/local/sbin/bdfingerd -i

and give inetd the ol' kill -s SIGHUP

The preferred use, however, would be to just start bdfingerd in your startup
rc scripts, with no options needed for a typical setup.


THANK YOU!

  See the output of the 'bdfingerd -h' command for help on the 
command-line options.
