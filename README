The Big Dumb Finger Daemon
==========================

Author: Lebbeous Fogle-Weekley (aka Lebbeous Weekley)

I don't think there can be many finger daemons on github, so I decided to haul
out this old thing.  Except for updating my email address just now, I haven't
touched this code in just over ten years.

Sometime I might review the TODOs, reformat the code in the style I would use
today, and go bughunting.  Maybe.  As I recall this actually worked pretty
well on Linux.  I'm not sure how much I actually knew about security in 2002.
I would take my assertions about the security of bdfingerd from that time with
a big grain of salt.

---------------

The Big Dumb Finger Daemon is meant to be a more secure and much more
configurable version for Linux of the common finger daemons, mostly 
derived from the original BSD code which comes preinstalled on many
UNIX machines today.

Unlike some other finger daemons out there which add many frivolous 
options, to the point of allowing users to provide outright false 
information to finger clients, bdfingerd's configurability is solely for 
the administator (though the .nofinger and such files work in the same way 
as with standard finger daemons).

As a standalone daemon (the way it was designed to be used), bdfingerd,
after being started as root (mostly so it can bind port 79), drops root
privileges and becomes the user 'nobody', improving security, before
accepting any client connections.  As of bdfingerd 0.9.5, inetd *is*
supported, if you want to use it that way.  Just invoke bdfingerd -i

*** For individual users on the system who value their privacy, one 
important advantage of bdfingerd over standard finger daemons is that
if the administrator sets up a finger spool repository (say
/var/spool/finger) with read/write/sticky-bit permissions for the
system's users (like /var/spool/mail and /tmp), the users can place
their project, plan, forward, pgpkey, and even nofinger files in that
repository instead of in their home directories, so that the information
contained in such files can be made public without giving away so much
as execute permission on one's own home directory.  Even nofinger will
work from this location as expected to hide a user, and to a user who
wants not to appear in finger requests, the privacy of being able
to have absolutely no world or even group permissions set on his
home directory are a plus.

An administrator may completely and happily neglect to create such a 
repository, however, and the finger daemon will still find nofinger, plan, 
and all those files in the users' home directories as always and will act
in the normal way.  Additionally, an administrator who doesn't want
her users to be able to use nofinger (or even plan, project, so on)
files can easily and specifically disable the use of each file in the
bdfingerd.conf file.

For a further understanding of bdfingerd's configurability, read the 
bdfingerd.conf file.  It's full of comments, and very easy to use. I 
think and hope you will find this to be a fairly professional and very
useful implementation of fingerd, and a worthy server for your machine(s).
