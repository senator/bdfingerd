This is version 0.9.5

   - to do,   * done,   = partial,    ? maybe done

* make 'Charlie &' work  (done 31 May 2002)
* make read for .project and .forward only one line
* short and long format controlled by /W and a cvar called
    MULTISTYLE, which can be set to either 'short' or 'long',
    and applies to the format of output for empty queries
    (who's-on-the-box queries).
* forwarding ('buddy@linux.com@otherhost.net'), of course disabled by
    default, controllable with cvar FORWARDING
* improve cvar system to set cvar->value appropriately when the string 
    read is 'yes', 'true', 'on', 'enabled', 'no', 'false', 'off', or 
    'disabled'.
? fix cvar reload behaviour (after SIGHUP)
* add cvar MATCHREALNAMES to toggle matching of client tokens to users'
    real names as well as login names (enable by default).
= add an inetd mode. this will work best after some things are cleaned up,
    especially in child.c
* add a command line option to specify pid file location
* add cvar FILESIZELIMIT to set a cap on the size of .plan and 
    other user files.
- work with the results of the configure script to actually do something
    based on whether certain functions are found, like bind
* go through code to find and address all FIXME's that can/should be
    reasonably handled before 0.9.5 release
- add functionality to allow 'ghost users', who have plan files in 
    /var/spool/finger, but do not exist in the system (not in /etc/passwd)
    Enable or disable functionality with cvar GHOSTUSERS.
- port to Solaris first, then tackle BSD.  Maybe for version 1.5 or 2.0.
